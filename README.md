          It also shows how teams can callaborate to create a larger final project.

              This program also requires pygame for Python 3.1 or newer. (https://bitbucket.org/pygame/pygame/downloads)

General: I was the group leader for a group of students that created this game. 
        Our only assignment was to create a project that would demonstrate inheritance. 
        However we wanted to go above and beyond. This is the result.
